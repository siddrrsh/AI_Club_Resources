# LearnAiResources
A series of public and simple presentations allowing users to gain knowledge in Artificial Intelligence through ML libraries and Python

Projects in AI begin with a simple knowledge of Python and linear algebra and progress to multi-faceted programming experiences with Neural Networks and backpropogation. 

ML Libraries are widely adaptable frameworks that integrate AI into our Python programs and functions.

Python with Anaconda is required. If you know Java and algorithmic programming or data structures, you can pick up Python in a few hours.

All ML library download instructions are included in the presentations. Libraries include Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras
